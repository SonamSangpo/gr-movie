    <p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Only eight colors that you need.</p>

    <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>

    <p>Be brave. There it is. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Anyone can paint. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Fluff that up.</p>

    <p>There we are. Everybody needs a friend. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>

    <p>That's crazy. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>

    <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>

    <p>The least little bit can do so much. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>
